      **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

      **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
    - |
      Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
    - |
      Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
    - |
      During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
    - |
      In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the patterns alerts.
  changes:
    - |
      To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for events related to the Management Console in an instance's enterprise audit log.
    - |
      People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
    - |
      On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding.
    - |
      The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the webhook payload for that push will not contain any commits. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/commits)."
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.

      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
